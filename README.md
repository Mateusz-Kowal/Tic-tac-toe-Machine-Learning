# Tic Tac Toe Machine Learning Demonstration


## Description

The goal of the program is to measure the accuracy of different classificaton algorithms by analysing all possible Tic Tac Toe game endings (the total of 958 outcomes) assuming that the player playing with 'x' starts.
Each list representing one game outcome contains 9 elements with values: 'x', 'o' or 'b' for blank square. The algorithm has to detect if the player playing with 'x' has won the game or not (2 classes).
